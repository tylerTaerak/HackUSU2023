# Flight Delay Prediction App

This project was created by Tyler Conley and Preston Bell at a Hackathon held at Utah State University.

This project uses a statistical/machine learning model to compute whether a given flight is expected to be delayed. The model accuracy is slightly above 80%. 
This project uses a simple Flask web application as a UI.

The training data needs to be downloaded from [this url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations?resource=download&select=full_data_flightdelay.csv)
It needs to be saved into `./content/` in order to train the model up properly.
